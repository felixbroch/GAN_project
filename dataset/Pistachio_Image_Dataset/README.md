# Pistachio Image Dataset Directory

This directory should contain the downloaded Pistachio Image Dataset.

## Expected Structure:
```
Pistachio_Image_Dataset/
├── Kirmizi_Pistachio/           # Red pistachio images (*.jpg files)
└── Pistachio_Image_Dataset_Request.txt
```

## Setup Instructions:
1. Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muratkoklu/pistachio-image-dataset)
2. Extract the contents to this directory
3. Verify that the Kirmizi_Pistachio folder contains .jpg image files

**Note**: The actual image files (.jpg) are excluded from Git due to their large size, but this directory structure will be preserved.
